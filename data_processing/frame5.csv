13,1/6 Zoro is enough because he is 6 admirals,58
14,"Zoro alone is overkill 🥶🥶

https://preview",153
19,"Wanji solos let me explain

Mid fight acoc bloom 

He uses this to make his leg even hotter getting black flames

black flames are hotter than magma

Low diff",138
20,4 Sanji’s as armor to tank the damage and 1 Zoro to deal damage,19
21,Like a Sanji mech with a Zoro pilot,19
22,"sanji and zoro alone are really close

2 sanji 1 zoro takes him",63
23,2 Zoros 1 Sanji,41
24,"Blue flames> magma

Sanji destroys",27
40,"A single sanji zoro duo beats him 

1 Sanji + 1 Zoro > akainu",7
42,They both can definitely hurt him (zoro can hurt him a lot),2
43,"What many people kind of disregard is that akainu is a ""normal"" human with a logia fruit",2
44,He isnt kaido,2
45,He isnt big mom,2
46,If zoro hits him with an ashura attack he will definitely not just brush that shit off,2
47,"Zoro should also sort of counter him since he can cut fire and magma and sanji should be quite heatresistant (blue fire is hotter than both magma and lava)

There also is a good chance that the katakuri thing that akainu also displayed in marineford wont work against ACOA and ACOC",2
50,2 zoros and maybe 3 sanjis,2
51,2 zoro’s and one sanji,2
59,Zoro=6 admirals,2
60,2 Sanjis and 1 Zoro probably gets it done,2
64,"The Admirals were not able to put Marco down at Marineford, and Akainu probobly hasnt gotten much, if any, stronger while being a desk jockey",2
65,Just like FA Sengoku was probobly weaker than Prime Sengoku,2
68,LOOKING AT YOU GREEN BULL),2
69,"Zoro and Sanji alone are close, but two duos should definitely get the job done",2
72,"Kid and law defeated Big Mom 2v1, and I feel that Zoro and Sanji are pretty comparable to those two",2
73,"I think if Akainu is about as strong as Big Mom (if not weaker), they've got it",2
74,"But if he turns out to be more powerful, they may need a second Sanji",2
77,Maybe 1 of either Zoro or Sanji and 2 of the other would be enough,1
78,Did you see zoro try to fight kaido,1
79,Zoro unleashes his biggest move and kaido was like OK,1
80,"Akainu would mid diff these bums, you'd need 3 of each to bring it to ext diff",1
81,So 4 sanjis and 3 zoros might be okay,1
82,"Zoro and Sanji truly mop the floor with him, you made my captain hurt…",1
90,2 Zoros + Sanji will likely be enough,1
94,1/6 zoros is enough,1
97,"if Zoro has acoc, because of the recent vivre cards",1
100,"They could prob duo, given how hot magma is and how hot blue flames are, they tend to be at the same heat, but magma can get a bit hotter, but most likely the magma would do nothing to Sanji",1
101,Then Zoro kills him,1
102,"Honestly, if Mid and Law can take a yonko then the wings of the future pirate king can take an admiral imho",1
103,"Zoro solos

https://preview",1
112,1/6 of Zoro if my math is correct,1
114,"Zoro = 6 admirals, so Sanji doesn't even need to be there",1
118,In Zoro’s around 3,1
119,In Sanji it is 3-4,1
124,one sanji and one zoro,-1
125,Sanji solos,-3
132,"At the same time: 2 Zoro 2 Sanjis

Just Zoro: 3 Zoros

Just Sanji: 6 Sanjis",0
133,"Yes I genuinely think Sanji is barely over half as strong as Zoro, and I think it will end that way too",0
134,I hate Sanji,0
136,Half a sanji and half a zoro is enough,-1
146,Prime Kaido vs,78
147,Prime Big Mom,78
148,It's a close fight to both of them and Prime Big Mom has a chance to win,78
149,"Powerscalers forgot the narrative and the story that Roger chose not to fight Big Mom when he stole her Road Poneglyph and according to Ace Novel the 3 Rulers of New World are Roger, Shiki and Whitebeard while Big Mom was leading her territories in the New World and take note that Big Mom's main crew are composed of her children",78
150,Big Mom terrorized the strongest country of the World at a young age,78
151,"According to Mother Caramel, Big Mom has the potential to become a Fleet Admiral at Rocks and Roger's Era",78
152,Big Mom Pirates are the longest reigning Pirate Crew in the New World,78
153,It will not happen if Big Mom is weak,78
161,"Roger/WB  
Garp/Sengoku  
Shanks/Mihawk  
Akainu/Kuzan  
Kaido/Big Mom  
Fujitora/Greenbull",42
162,Yeah that Kid and Law fight really lowered our perception of her when her and kaido should be kinda like mihawk and shanks,9
163,Its kinda like what happen with greenbull but not as bad,9
168,"Kaido pushes Roger,wb and garp to extreme diff and beats sengoku",81
170,Kaido has much much much better feats,10
172,"Just to make sure, because I don't believe there is a real difference, both are relative to Kaido anyway",6
173,"Dope mama art, she is HER",6
179,"On Wano, Kaidou and Big Mom are relative to one another",5
180,"Prime to Prime however I see Prime Big Mom as being a bit stronger than Prime Kaidou, she was on the bottom level of the Top Tiers in Roger’s Time and is basically implied to be the 4th Great Power of the Seas in Roger’s Time as well following God Valley",5
181,"Kaidou on the other hand only reached his Prime, from what’s been shown anyway, around the time that the old-guard (including Big Mom) were becoming past their Prime, with even Old Whitebeard being a threat to Prime Kaidou",5
183,Bm with 5 years soul amp > Kaido,4
185,Big Mom was the second strongest Yonko when she fell imo,9
186,"I'll preface all of this by saying if this is meant to compare Prime Big Mom and Prime Kaido then Yeah, I think Prime BM is an underrated beast and they're prob pretty relative and ignore everything else im gonna say below lol

If were talking current day BM and Prime Kaido (current Kaido) I wouldn't say they're relative in most stats",3
187,"Before Onigashima, I believe they were being portrayed as equals, however Kaido outpaces her by a large margin once we hit roofpiece",3
188,"I'd say her physical strength is somewhere near base Kaido, seeing as she was able to knock Luffy out of G4 in one clash on WCI",3
189,"Base Kaido was able to defeat  Luffy at the beginning of Wano, who's durability should be relative to when he was in WCI",3
190,You can argue Luffy was more durable at this point but either way I don't think the gap is that Large,3
191,Once Kaido enters his Hybrid form he's clear of BM in this regard,3
192,I think BM's most relative stat is her durability,3
194,Kaido also eats a ton of of ACOC attacks tho so not sure how well this holds up,3
195,"Speed it's not even close, as BM acts more like a damage sponge and just tries to eat everything thrown her way, meanwhile Kaido was speed blitzing snakeman in his Dragon Form",3
197,"While BM is able to output a level of Haki that can seemingly match Kaido's with the Hakai, it doesn't seem like she can consistently output the same level of Haki as the only other time she uses ACOC in the arc is against Page 1",3
198,Meanwhile Kaido is shown to consistently use ACOC throughout the arc comfortably,3
199,Kaido also has futuresight  and we have no confirmation BM can use advanced advanced observation at all,3
200,"Destructive capability with their DFs can be contested tho, as BM uses multiple attacks that seem to have a similar scope of range to Kaido's with the Fulgora and Tenjin",3
201,It's debatable on who is stronger tho as Kaido's Blast breath punched clean through the island while Fulgora only punched a hole through its side,3
202,"Her DC is inconsistent tho, as she'll do something as impressive as Fulgora then bust out Mother Misery which is propped up to be a serious attack   that can't even put down Kid",3
208,"width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a71a00ad13176ab2c1b2425a860a168837cf50ed

I know that Big Mom is on par with Kaido, but it's so hard to take her seriously bro",3
209,Big Mom is an idiot and can probably be baited into a loss,3
210,Kaido is also an idiot and probably cannot bait her,3
213,"Big Mom's physicals are relative to base Kaido, apart from durability",9
214,The reason why Kid was able to land his strongest attacks on her despite the long charge up times is because she's a slower opponent,9
215,Hybrid Kaido was blitzing and wiping the floor with Luffy once he stopped fucking around,9
217,Even with Garp vs Roger,9
218,I'm willing to bet Roger had superior CoC while Garp's CoA was in a tier of its own seeing as he's still dropping nukes with ACoA emission despite being a fraction of his prime strength,9
230,"I don’t know about relative in every single stat (I think Kaido has slightly better physical strength and straight up better durability, while Big Mom gaps in hax and attack variety) but yeah, I think they’re relative",2
231,"In fact, I believe that if we let Big Mom go out and use a large chunk of her lifespan, that she would win every time out of 100",2
236,"Yeah, strongest version of big mom and base kaido",3
247,"width=538&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f680b9bb97a2d4154282e02859e5ca728db7f0c2

So true big mom has always been HER",2
248,"this is fair, Big Mom lost a lot of stock in the OP community by losing on a ring out in a battle she should’ve convincingly won",2
249,her fault anyway for playing with her food with Law and Kidd,2
251,Nah Kaido mid diffs Big Mom cope,6
252,Laido stops mid diff at most I be giving no fuck about your changing mind tho,3
253,"Kaido himself: LinLin, you've become a non-factor",3
256,"She's relative to a base Kaido, not V2 hybrid that Luffy fought",0
258,If both prime I’m putting my money on Mama,1
261,"Big mom is betrayed to be relative to Kaido, but her feats are just worse, her battle iq is honestly pretty retarded and she has no impressive speed feats or at least not anything comparable to Kaido, Shanks and Luffy",1
262,"The fact she lost to Kid and Law is a huge anti feat for her ngl, also she used a named attack on a injured Ulti who isn't even low commander level and she got back up which is also another anti feat she has",1
263,You can argue oda had to nerf big mom for plot and you're probably not entirely wrong but based on feats she's not on Kaido's level,1
264,"I'm not some nerd who has memorized everything they did, but I did see a video going over everything they both did and Kaido had far better feats than she did and from what I could tell it didn't seem bias, I would link the video if I remembered where to find it but you might find it if you look for it, all I know is that it was on YouTube",1
270,Kizaru's beating her ass,1
272,"Prime Linlin > Prime Kaido

But Old Linlin < Current Kaido 

Is your mind changed now",1
274,"Base Kaido is relative to big meme, now add uo uo no mi and Kaido stomps meme

his stats are amplified by his DF",2
275,"Kaido is faster by a gigantic amount, has better CoO by a gigantic amount, has much greater durability, and has much better AP",0
276,She is tiers below Kaido,0
280,Good try at the kid upscale though,1
292,Is this prime bigmom,1
293,"If so I agree 100% 

Prime Bigmom >~ Kaido > Old Bigmom",1
294,Kaido would cook Big Mom,1
296,You always bet on Kaido,1
298,"Yes, given that BM is using lifespan amps like against Law and Kidd",0
300,"Otherwise, just like in Onigashima, Kaido would alr be fighting in hybrid but he would just keep ramping up more and more until he leaves her behind eventually",0
302,"Maturing is realising Kaido is in the low Yonko tier with Big Mom and Old Whitebeard, and below the high Yonko/PK tier with Shanks, Roger and Prime Whitebeard",-4
303,Big mom is **not** relative to Kaido lmao,-1
304,Big Mom is the only yonko to play second fiddle to another  and the only yonko who’s final attack was dispatched with the most casual attack ever,-1
305,"Everybody went to that roof to challenge kaido, nobody cared for big mom",-1
314,Dorry and Broggy,254
315,"Garp vs Roger

Roger verbatim admitted they fought with killing intent (meaning they fought each other going all out trying to kill each other) and both survived the battles",72
316,They’re the most equal matchup in the series outside of Dory and Broggy lol,72
317,Aokiji vs Akainu,144
318,Garp vs Roger,86
319,"Roger said they almost killed each other several times, so I took that to mean that sometimes Roger had the better of Garp and sometimes Garp had the better of Roger",86
323,"Garp vs roger with the admirals being a close 2nd

garp and roger fought w/ killing intent, and neither of them are dead, meaning neither beat each other and were dead equals

328,Garp vs Roger is the only one where there isn't a winner,10
332,What is Mihawk doing,3
336,Roger and garp then the two admirals,3
337,"I'm guessing kaido beats big mom pretty handily tbh from full health, his feats were just so much more impressive",3
338,I no longer believe shanks and mihawk is an extreme diff fight,3
339,I'm guessing shanks is a good bit stronger now as shanks has been active and mihawk has been drinking wine and picking on random monkeys for the past decade,3
341,"Aokiji and Akainu, cmon, they fought for 10 days there power level is almost the same",3
343,Akainu and Aokiji,3
344,"Big Mom is definitively weaker than Kaido, and he outright says as such when he gets drunk and keeps fighting ACOC Luffy when he comments on how he hasn't had a good fight in a long time",3
345,This was only a day or so after having an absolute slugfest with Big Mom,3
346,Hybrid Kaido going all out would defeat FP Big Mom on the middling end of high diff,3
348,"Shanks and Mihawk never went beyond a stalemate during their duels, even with all the Haki blooms and advancements that they made",3
349,Same for Roger and Garp,3
351,"Akainu and Aokiji fought for ten days straight, going all out and giving each other major injuries and scars",3

367,"either akainu and kuzan or garp and roger 

shanks has clearly fallen below mihawk with time, and unless big mom sacrifices whatever remaining years of her life she has left them kaido beats her in base",2
368,Aokiji vs Akainu and it's not even close,2
370,People are going to say Kuzan vs,2
371,Akainu because Oda overhyped this fodder fight,2

378,Shanks v Mihawk if they actually fought close to death,1
383,Shanks vs Mihawk was a draw,1
385,"Canonically Roger and Garp have nearly killed each other multiple times,while the rest have either had one duel or draws",1

398,"Shit if you wanna be shankstard about it you could go ""erm actually Mihawk said he lost by saying he doesn't want to settle things"" in which case point still stands Aokiji akianu was closer",1
399,Kaido as far as we know didn't use his fruit against big mom,1
400,Sure alot of it was off screen but god damn kaidos fruit makes him a different beast,1
409,Only akainu and aokiji had a clear winner,1
410,Kaido had way better feats so he’s over big mom for sure,1

583,Dont actually think its kaido actually,4
584,We got told that a big strength of zoans is their regeneration so I think kaido is simply indirectly more durable because he regenerates very fast in battles as well,4
585,"A zoan awakening is also only typically meant to basically buff all the physical stat boosts that you already got - so its possible the regen is even greater because he might have awakened

Big mom might be an argument, allthough can you really call it impressive durability if you are simple so tanky that basically nothing even damages you",4
586,With that in mind it might be luffy,4
587,"Luffy get damaged by most attacks and still powers through - the regen he has only seems to have kicked in in gear 5, but he tanked a fuck ton of yonko attacks before that",4

Also noting that Kaido is stated multiple times to be unparalleled in vitality which plays a heavy role when it comes to endurance, 
(**Vitality is a key factor in sustaining endurance**) 

His Vivre Card literally says **“Due to his unparalleled vitality no one could kill him",1
620,Whitebeard,1
622,Is Gol D Roger the father of Luffy,1
632,Vista would have a better chance since no df,50
636,I have Marco > pre gura bb but matchup diff Marco loses,68
637,Marco hs Devil Fruit disadvantage,13
640,only Vista Can hunt him,13
643,"Ace was the second-strongest commander, it's not like there was a huge difference in power level between the top 1 and top 2, we only know Marco feats now because of hindsight and post time skip scaling, pre time skip I see no reason why they wouldn't be relative",40
644,"His main powers coming from regen is useless when BB just turns his fruit off, ace had tons of range and large scale moves to fend BB off",40
646,"I mean… of any of the commanders or top tiers in general, Marco is one of the biggest Fruit mains",5
647,So is Blackbeard but Blackbeard can’t have his fruits negated,5
648,"Like, what is Marco without his fruit",5
651,"Regardless, Blackbeard can do the exact same thing to Marco that he did to Ace: suck him in with his gravity, grab him (with haki or just his fruit), negate his fruit, and choke him just like he did to Ace",5
655,"BB wins

BB still has his entire crew, and Marco would lose his regen when grabbed by BB, and BB is honestly no joke when he's actually forced to fight",8
657,Ace lasted as long as he did because he had range,20
658,Marco's getting grabbed once and then beaten to death,20
660,Bb slams,5
663,Hes also not on Law's level that he somehow still does well,4
665,"Marco Polo after Blackbeard grabs him once

https://preview",8
672,Ace’s fighting style revolves around fire,2
673,"Marco is a melee combatant, which is worse for teach since he needs to be close to cancel devil fruits or do any real damage",2
675,"Marco would do better than Ace since tho he can't use his devil fruit when BB grabs him, his powers would allow him to fully heal between hits",2
676,Assuming he can do enough damage to BB while getting pulled and when he's grabbed to force him to let go like Ace did,2
679,"Don't see Marco winning, BB's just a horrid matchup for him",2
681,Marco wouldn't have been captured but tbh,2
685,"idk if he would win

Considering how BB has devil fruit nomination and Marco is a close range fighter when he attacks, could be just a bad matchup

That being said, Marco is a tier above Yami Blackbeard overall",2
686,Marco stomps,2
691,"Bb got fodderized by Magellan who was getting pushed by gear 2 pre time skip luffy

Marco speed blitzes pre gura bb badly",2
692,I would imagine Marco to be more then capable without his DF,2
693,I can imagine he went 1000s of rounds against Whitebeard since he was a kid,2
695,"No way, Blackbeard bests him",2
696,Marco with 2nd to Whitebeard,2
698,We didn’t see much from that fight but ace has the better range and area control which BB can also rival,3
699,Marco’s main strength comes from his regen which BB can negate with each hit,3
700,BB likely takes this,3
702,Marco loses as well,2
704,Plus I think BB had great haki as well,2
707,Marco should be generally stronger but I do think its a bad matchup for him,2
710,Marco is neg diffing him,1
711,Banaro Teach > your favorite character,1

754,"I don't know bro, Blackbeard is ugly",-1
766,But if Kizaru = 9 admirals then doesn't that mean an admiral is worth 9 admirals so then Zoro = 54 admirals 😭😭,41
773,Kizaru is the prototypical Admiral,11
774,"If he = 9 admirals, and Zoro = 6 Admirals, then Zoro = 54 Admirals",11
775,Put this through the loop a few more times and you quickly scale Zoro to outerversal power levels,11
776,"Since this is a closed loop that will continue forever, Zoro = infinity Admirals 🔥🔥🔥",11
777,Wtf is Zoro = 6 Admirals,7

811,Does Kizaru even have the AP to hurt Kaido,12
813,Kizaru cooks the fish,14
815,The only way it helps is if the bean flies up in the air and then lands in KOd Kizaru’s open mouth after a Death Destroyer Thunder Bagua like water falling on Luffy in Alabasta,3
